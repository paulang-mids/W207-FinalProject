- **test.csv** - This is the file with the test data. Please note that the size of this file is 72 MB.
- **train.csv** - This is the filw with the training data.
- **KaggleScores.png** - Image of the Kaggle scores
- **Submission_FinalModel.csv** - Predictions for the first submission to Kaggle
- **Submission_Ensemble.csv** - Predictions for the second submission to Kaggle
- **Submission_ETCModel.csv** - Predictions for the third submission to Kaggle
	
In order for the notebook to run properly, the notebook, train data file and test data file should be downloaded and placed in the same folder.
