The dataset was provided by Jock A. Blackard and Colorado State University and the dataset is hosted by Bache, K. & Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.


The files included in this repository are:
- **ForestCoverPrediction.ipynb** - This notebook has all the code used for Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Fitting and Predictions. The total runtime for the entire notebook is close to **15 minutes**. 
- **test.csv** - This is the file with the test data.
- **train.csv** - This is the filw with the training data.
- **KaggleScores.png** - Image of the Kaggle scores
- **Submission_FinalModel.csv** - Predictions for the first submission to Kaggle
- **Submission_Ensemble.csv** - Predictions for the second submission to Kaggle
- **Submission_ETCModel.csv** - Predictions for the third submission to Kaggle
	
In order for the notebook to run properly, the notebook, train data file and test data file should be downloaded and placed in the same folder.
